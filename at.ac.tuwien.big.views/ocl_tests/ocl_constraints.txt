A list of possible OCL Constraints defined in the specification and implemented in the .ecore file:

------- /// DOMAIN MODEL /// -------

* Constraint 1 - UniqueIdIsContainedOrInherited: One of the contained or inherited properties
* Constraint 2 - ClassPropertyTypeIsValid: The properties have either a data type or an enumeration set as type
* Constraint 3 - ClassPropertyBoundsAreValid: Only the lower bounds “0” and “1” and the upper bound “1” are allowed
* Constraint 4 - IdBoundsAreValid: A property serving as id of a class has to be mandatory, i.e., it has to have a lower bound and upper bound of “1”
* Constraint 5 - NoCyclicInheritance: A class cannot inherit from itself and cyclic inheritance relationships between classes are not allowed 
* Constraint 6 - AssociationPropertyBoundsAreValid: The multiplicities of these properties are restricted as follows: 
                 the upper bound has to be greater than or equal to the lower bound, the lower bound has to be greater than 
                 or equal to “0”, and the upper bound has to be greater than “0”.
         
------- /// VIEWS MODEL /// -------

* Constraint 7 - OneStartViewExistsWithinAViewGroup: A view group defines one of these contained views as start view that is the main view of the view group
* Constraint 8 - OneWelcomeGroupExists: One view group of the view model serves as the so-called welcome view group
* Constraint 9 - TargetViewOfClassIndexViewLinksIsValid: Class index views may define links to class operation views that are defined for the respective class
* Constraint 10 - PropertyElementsReferToValidClassProperties: Property elements may only be defined for properties that are defined or inherited by this class 
* Constraint 11 - AssociationElementsReferToValidClass: Association elements may only be defined for associations that are defined or inherited by this class 
* Constraint 12 - PropertyElementOfComparisonConditionsIsValid: A comparison condition defines that an element group or 
				  view element shall be shown, hidden, enabled, or disabled if a specific comparison value is equal to, 
				  less than, or greater than the one entered via a specific property element that is contained by the same 
				  class operation view as the element group or view element. 
* Constraint 13 - ElementIdIsUnique: View elements have a unique element identifier	
* Constraint 14	- TargetViewOfAssociationElementLinksIsValid: Association Elements define links to class operation views that are defined for the respective class
* Constraint 15 - TableColumnRefersToTargetViewClassProperty: Note that the properties selected for columns have
				  to be properties that are contained by the associated class.
* Constraint 16 - PropertyTypeOfTextIsValid: Text view elements can be used for properties that  have as type either a user-defined data type or an enumeration
* Constraint 17 - PropertyTypeOfDateTimePickerIsValid: Date time pickers can be used for properties that have as type a user-defined data type named “Date”, “Time”, or “DateTime”
* Constraint 18 - PropertyTypeOfSelectionIsValid: Selection view elements can be used for properties that have as type either a user-defined data type or an enumeration
* Constraint 19 - ConditionIdIsUnique: View elements have a unique element identifier
* Constraint 20 - ComposedConditionTypesAreEqual: The types of all combined conditions must be the same as the one set for the containing composite condition
